# Tasks

A WIP app for managing tasks using a calendar-like week view.

## Tech stack

- The whole app is built on Kotlin multiplatform, with jvm, Android, and wasmJs targets.
- UI is done via [compose multiplatform](https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-multiplatform/) using Material 3
  components.
- The backend is built on [ktor](https://ktor.io/) and uses [Exposed](https://github.com/JetBrains/Exposed) for database
  access.
